  Idea
 -
 Ever have trouble finding a common date to meet up with your friends? With Get-A-Life, a user (host) can create an event within a range of dates and invite other users (guests) to select the dates that they are free. This helps the host select a final meeting date where most of the attendees can make it.

  Creation Process:
  -
  This app was created among 5 mentees for our final group project during ThoughtWorks Jumpstart! program. During the 3 weeks we had, we practiced working in an agile team - from writing user stories, wire-framing, pair programming and swapping story/partner every 2 days to holding stand-up and retrospectives meetings.
