### Idea
Ever have trouble finding a common date to meet up with your friends? With Get-A-Life, a user (host) can create an event within a range of dates and invite other users (guests) to select the dates that they are free. This helps the host select a final meeting date where most of the attendees can make it.

### Creation Process:
This app was created among 5 mentees for our final group project during ThoughtWorks Jumpstart! program. During the 3 weeks we had, we practiced working in an agile team - from writing user stories, wire-framing, pair programming and swapping story/partner every 2 days to holding stand-up and retrospectives meetings.

### Created with
NodeJS | REACT | Semantic UI React | React Infinite Calendar | Express | MongoDB (on Heroku mLab) | TDD practice | and automated tests with Jest | Cypress test | Circle CI | Swagger UI | mongoose | passport-jwt
